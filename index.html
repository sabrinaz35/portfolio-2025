            Hi, my name is Sabrina Zuurbier and i'm currently in my third year
            of the study Communication and multimedia design at the Hogeschool
            van Amsterdam.
            <br />
            Some of my ambitions are, to get better at coding and technical
            stuff on websites and to develop my visual skills and combine these
            with the technical ones.
            <br />
            On the other hand in my free time i'm busy with photography, I'm
            also still learning this skill. And I have a fascination about urban
            sketching and aquarel art.
          </p>

              During this minor I got to learn multiple ways to visualize data.
              The first six weeks we're al about charts and diagrams. We got
              guestclasses form Andy Kirk whom explained the way of the CHRTS
              method. And we made our own visualization using a small piece of
              the ndff data set.
              <br />
              The following six weeks I joined the visual track were I learned
              important things like how to display and organize data, with data
              collected from the Dappermarkt in Amsterdam. For instance we made
              an autonomy of a product, I used roasted chestnuts and a process
              of... were I tried to visualize the way of filleting a salmon.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In the last project I worked on a visual interactive prototype
              about climate change for the company CleverFranke. We as a group
              studied a dataset we had gotten from them an we chose to find a
              story to tell in the winters which are getting warmer. We made a
              prototype in Figma which shows the the journey of an ice-skater,
              his dream is to eventually skate the Elfstedentocht a dutch
              legendary skating competition. But along the way he comes to the
              realization it's maybe not possible for him to ride one.

              For the subject Frontend development I needed to remake a website
              as similar as possible. We got a choice to focus on the
              responsiveness or make it visual better by adding some more
              aspects.
              <br />
              I chose the website mojo's, because there was enough challenge
              there for me to concure, first hand I chose to focus on making the
              site responsive and in the end I added some fun gradient effect,
              when you choose the disco genre.
              <br />
              This project was fun to do, but was hard at sometimes, especially
              if some code doesn't work as you thought it would. But it makes it
              more fun it does work!
              <br />
              During this project I used HTML, CSS and some Javascript and the
              tools VSCode and Github.

              The goal with this project was to make an interactive site using
              Javascript. The idea I had for this project came from a game I
              used to play when I was younger called Pou and wondered if I could
              make something similar.
            </p>
            <p>
              There were some struggles because this was the first project where
              I used javascript. But I wanted to challenge myself and add some
              dynamic display for the health bars.

            type="MP4"
          ></video>

          <p>
            In this project I made in a group of four an interactive song
            swiper, something like Tinder but then for songs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two persons focused on the frontend en the other two had a focus on
            the backend. My part in this project was the backend, my main focus
            was on the database and inserting the function to let people login
            and save that in the database. After that i made a couple of
            function were it saves the liked songs in the database.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this project I exploited my knowledge about the backend and also
            learned more functions to work with in github. This project was the
            first time working with branches, which was challenging, but we made
            it work.
